    :code:`mutate -list N [options] [selection]` ::

        Create a list of N mutations using an even sampling.


    :code:`-o filename` ::

            Write list to this file instead of console output


    :code:`-s filename` ::

            Write a list of all src tags found in the design to the specified file


    :code:`-seed N` ::

            RNG seed for selecting mutations


    :code:`-none` ::

            Include a "none" mutation in the output


    :code:`-ctrl name width value` ::

            Add -ctrl options to the output. Use 'value' for first mutation, then
            simply count up from there.

    :code:`-wirebit int`

    :code:`-src string` ::

            Filter list of mutation candidates to those matching
            the given parameters.

    :code:`mutate -mode MODE [options]` ::

        Apply the given mutation.


    :code:`-ctrl name width value` ::

            Add a control signal with the given name and width. The mutation is
            activated if the control signal equals the given value.


    :code:`-module name`

    :code:`-cell name`

    :code:`-port name`

    :code:`-portbit int`

    :code:`-ctrlbit int` ::
