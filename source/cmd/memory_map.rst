    :code:`memory_map [options] [selection]` ::

        This pass converts multiport memory cells as generated by the memory_collect
        pass to word-wide DFFs and address decoders.


    :code:`-attr !<name>` ::

            do not map memories that have attribute <name> set.


    :code:`-attr <name>[=<value>]` ::

            for memories that have attribute <name> set, only map them if its value
            is a string <value> (if specified), or an integer 1 (otherwise). if this
            option is specified multiple times, map the memory if the attribute is
            to any of the values.


    :code:`-iattr` ::

            for -attr, ignore case of <value>.


    :code:`-rom-only` ::

            only perform conversion for ROMs (memories with no write ports).


    :code:`-keepdc` ::

            when mapping ROMs, keep x-bits shared across read ports.


    :code:`-formal` ::

            map memories for a global clock based formal verification flow.
            This implies -keepdc, uses $ff cells for ROMs and sets hdlname
            attributes. It also has limited support for async write ports
            as generated by clk2fflogic.
